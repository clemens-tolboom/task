The task module let's users manage tasks in a simple, yet powerful way.
A task can be anything from a simple to-do item to a more complicated
project-related task. It's designed with individuals, small businesses,
and institutions in mind. However, it should be able to handle just about
any task you can think of.
 
Please note that this module is under heavy development and should not be used
in production environments.
